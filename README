tune_injection
==============

A web extension to demonstrate plain-text cookie password
vulnerability targeting the Telkom University's Network
Engine.

The injected script will grab your SSO account's
credentials.

This web ext targets everyone who's connected to the TUNE
wifi (logged in with an SSO account).

In order to execute this script successfully, the attacker
needs to social engineer the target to install the web
extension.

Using the script
----------------

Patch the script, add ```console.log sso_account``` to EOF
or, run this command: 

echo "console.log sso_account" >> src/main.coffee

or, if you prefer, use the alert function.

Install the required dependencies, then build the web
extension itself.

Use it on your web browser (currently tested on Gecko
engine)

Last step, connect to a database, steal credentials.
